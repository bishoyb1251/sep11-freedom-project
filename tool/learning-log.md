### 10/15/24:
* I used kaboom.js.com to be able to see the code that kaboom and or game pages uses to be able to make games.
https://github.com/replit/kaboom Is what I saw to see some code that I needed for kaboom.js

I also used https://impactjs.com/ to be able to play a game that was on the website which is a shooting game.

### 10/16/24:
* Some things that I tried was using some of the code that I saw on kaboom.js to try to imitate what I saw on the impact.js
