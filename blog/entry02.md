#### Overview of impact
Impactjs is a HTML5 coding game engine that allows you to be able to make games and allows you to use weltmiester which me and my partner had a pretty big problem to be able to  use impactjs proffeciently. We of course ran into a bunch of problems making it that we could not make it work


#### How it works
Impact consists of a bunch of files but the most important one which makes the whole impact engine work is weltmeister which I ran into some problems trying to navigate weltmeister and making it hard to navigate. Weltmeister is the backbone of the code enhancign what you see and evenmore.


#### Why did I choose Impact
I choose impact because it seemed like a easy and fun route to go. I wanted to create a shooting game and impactjs has a game on their website that basically you can shoot some kind of animals making it that when you get to the end you win other types of guns and more animals.


#### Problems so far
The weltmeister had me at as massive struggle because well it did not allow us to work. We made it work.
